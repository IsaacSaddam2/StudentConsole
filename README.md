# Grade Promoter Application

## Objective

A separate document will be shared detailing the objective.  

## Application Overview

The Grade Promoter application is used to decide if a pupil has achieved a pass rate in their exams, so that they can be promoted to the next school grade.  The academics team collate the a list of all pupil exam scores in a single CSV.  This is the input to the application.

The CSV will contain multiple pupils, across a number of grades.  Each pupil is expected to only sit exams in a single grade in any one year.  Each pupil will sit a number of exams in different subjects and types (mid-term, end-term).

A pupil can be promoted to the next school grade, if they achieve an average score greater than 50.

## Implementation

The application is implemented as a dotnet core 2.0 console application.  The tests are executed using Xunit.  The application can be developed in either Visual Studio 2017 or VS Code.
